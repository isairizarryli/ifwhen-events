              <ul>
                <li>Events that feel welcoming and lived-in, not stiff or over-produced.</li>
                <li>Clear communication so you always know what’s handled.</li>
                <li>Honoring your budget, priorities, and comfort level.</li>
                <li>Small touches that make guests feel seen and cared for.</li>
